**Seam Carver implementaion in python**

This project was made for a contest for a collage course (Not a coding competion, was based around math applications)

I made the API for graphs at first for a course i took in summer vacation, took the chance when i saw that this was one of the proposed ideas and improved on it,
as expected, most of the time i worked on optimizing the code

**Graphs**

A linear algebra aplication used in many popular laws such as Kirchoff's, it is used to preform calculations on matrices that represent circuits for example.
In CS, they are used in many algorithms and in fields such as image processing, we typically aim to put them in arrays in a manner we can reach all connected nodes to any node we
access by it's index.
